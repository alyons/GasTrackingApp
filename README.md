Gas Tracking App============A simple way to track your gas expenditure.## Planned Features - [ ] Track your gas mileage on a vehicle - [ ] Track mileages for different vehicles - [ ] Track mileages across multiple devices - [ ] Compare your mileage against the cars rating## Why am I building thisI have wanted to track my gas and see how well I am driving... or more correctly, how efficiently am I driving. Too many other trackers are either too much or are not very well designed (astetically), so I figured I would through my hat in the ring. This project will hopefully be able to be expanded to iOS soon if all goes according to plan.## Systems Used[Graph View (for Android)](http://www.android-graphview.org/) - This is used to create the graphs within the app.[Realm](http://realm.io/) - This is used for the back end so that things can be made simply and quickly. If I decide to make an iOS version of this app, this should speed up the process.
